#### 
Polling and webhooks are two different approaches to obtain real-time data updates in software systems. Polling involves repeatedly checking a server or endpoint for updates at specified intervals. While it's straightforward, it can be inefficient and may lead to unnecessary resource usage. In contrast, webhooks enable the server to notify a client whenever there is new data available, reducing the need for constant polling and improving efficiency. Webhooks are more responsive and scalable, making them a preferred choice for real-time applications and reducing network traffic compared to traditional polling mechanisms.

polling is ideal in situations where continuous updates are expected. Like live monitoring dashboards for stock marketing for example.ðŸ“‰ ðŸ“ˆ
  Hereâ€™s to my fresher network.
  **Imagine you're waiting for a package to be delivered to your house:**
  
  1. **Webhooks**:
   - Webhooks are like having a special bell that rings at your door, and the delivery person pushes it whenever they arrive with a package. You don't have to keep checking the door; you'll instantly know when the package is there.
  
  2. **Polling**:
   - Polling is more like you constantly going to the window and looking outside to see if the delivery person is there yet. You might check every few minutes, and if they're not there, you keep checking. It's like you're being more proactive in finding out when the package arrives.
